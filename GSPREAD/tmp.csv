_just so you know 2d anim will move dad a bit more to the right
_convert bg to 16 and make sure the color profile is set to sRgb
_fix house persp (wattersons house perspective is not matching with the houses beside)
_create hole on roof (make it just as a subtle line, as it's part of the joke of this shot not to reveal it too much)
_make the underneath part of porch visible on the reflection of the window
_refine masks of the houses (wattersons and robinsons) and fix problem on roof of robinsons (top right) 
_fix bottom lef of bg, erase bush and tree trunk or cover them with the 2d trashbags (grab them from the wattersons front establishing)
_make the window of gumball room open (put an inside for it), to match sc 009, scale it down a bit and move it upper so we have a bit of a gap between it and the roof (check establishing, ask me if unclear) 
_add 2d wooden ladder (tweak the persp to fix it as the ladder in LO is off), and shadow, keep it separated
_blur the trees in the back right",,2.5,Quentin Pointillart,rdy,2D easy,
